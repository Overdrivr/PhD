The automotive field is currently driven by the major trend of fully autonomous driving.
This type of application has high responsabilities towards human safety.
Proper operation of electronic systems must be guaranteed.
This is challenging because the automotive environment is very harsh, because for instance of electrical stresses such as the Electrostatic Discharge (ESD).
An electrostatic discharge is a very short but violent flow of electricity between two objects of different charge.
Electrostatic discharge can destroy electronic components, or disturb them during their normal operation.
This research work is focused on the second kind of issues.
New analysis and prediction methods are proposed to help guaranteeing that electronic modules will perform as expected.
These tools enable to model integrated functions using simulation tools or to acquire more data for understanding how disturbances propagate inside a chip.
