The automotive field is currently driven by the major trend of fully autonomous driving.
Given the criticity of this class of applications, safety of operation of electronic systems must be guaranteed.
This is very challenging because the automotive environment is very harsh in terms of stresses, and in particular electrical stresses such as
Electrostatic Discharges (ESD).
An electrostatic discharge is a very short but violent flow of electricity between two objects of different charge.
Electrostatic discharge can destroy electronic components, or disturb them during their normal operation.
In this research work, we focus on the second kind of issues.
New analysis and prediction methods are proposed to help guaranteeing that electronic modules will perform as expected.
These tools enable to model integrated functions using simulation tools, or to acquire more data at the silicon level for understanding further how disturbances propagate inside a chip.
