\subsection{Study of a real product}
\label{sec:real-product-study}

% What kind of product
The product under test is an SBC ?
automotive product
It does THIS and THAT

% What is being tested
In this product, our operating \gls{esd} study is focused on the primary supply function.
It is an interesting study case because this block is responsible for starting and waking up all other functions in the \gls{ic}.
Also, this function has an external input pin, exposed at the system level (battery connection).
This input can realistically be exposed at system-level ESD stresses (see biblio).
And the function also has an external output pin, the regulated supply, which is convenient for monitoring during tests.
