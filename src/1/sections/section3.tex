\section{State of the art in ESD testing}

To ensure proper operation once in the field, hardware is tested against ESD using different test methods and standards.
The goal for each method is to reproduce a particular ESD waveform in lab conditions.
In this chapter, we will introduce most relevant ESD generators, which will be useful later on for modeling them accurately.

\subsection{Transmission Line Pulsing (TLP)}
Transmission Line Pulsing uses the discharge of a cable to generate a fast and square pulse.
It is extensively used in the ESD field \cite{TLP, TLPforESDProtectionCz, TLPthroubleshooting, LacrampeTransientImmunity}, for characterization purpose or day-to-day testing of devices.
