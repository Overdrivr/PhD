\section{General introduction}

% Trends of the electronic field is size reduction
Electronic circuits become more miniaturized year after year.
There are many economical or practical reasons behind this trend.
Size reduction of integrated circuits lowers manufacturing cost per chip thanks to the increased volume.
Decreasing the weight of an embedded automotive system diminishes fuel and energy consumption.
Miniaturization also offers increased performance and capabilities.
More functions can be packed in the same volume.

% How is size reduced
For integrated circuits, this trend is accomplished by decreasing integrated technology size.
An integrated technology defines the dimensions and shapes of fundamental electronic bricks.
Those bricks consist in different types of transistors, resistors and capacitors.
The size of a technology is the smallest dimension for the smallest transistor gate, denoted \textlambda.
The value of \textlamda is essential and determines the size, power consumption, switching speed, performance and many other characteristics of the complete chip.
Until recently, Moore's law successfully predicted that technology dimensions will be reduced by a factor of two every 18 months.
As a side effect, miniaturization results in more fragile and less robust circuits.
%TODO detail more this
The maximum tolerated levels decrease with the technology size.

% Another trend in automotive - more electronic functions
Nowadays, new major features are developped in the automotive field.
The development of assisted or fully autonomous driving is seeing tremendous progress.
Autonomous vehicles take decisions and perform critical actions such as braking or steering the wheel.
Thoses features are implemented for safety purposes and put very high requirements on the operating safety of electronic modules.
Similarly, electric cars raise new challenges for safety, such as battery monitoring and control.
Those features require more computing power, more sensing capabilities and more data to exchange.
To support it, the amount of \gls{ecu}s and electronic modules is growing quickly in the automotive field.
Communication buses are shared by multiple systems, such as the CAN or LIN bus.
New standards and specifications are written to support higher bandwidths.
%TODO: Reference + complete
The CAN bus with Flexible Data rate (CAN-FD) is a good illustration.
Also means more sensitive to noise and disturbances.

% Another trend is reduced power consumptions
Another consequence of those trends is the rise of the vehicle's power consumption.
At the integrated circuit level, the main solution so far is to lower supply voltages.
With the smallest integrated technologies, it is common now to find supply voltages below 1V.
As a consequence, the noise margins become very small, making the circuits far more sensitive to electrical disturbances.

% Harsh environment in the automotive field
%TODO
On the other hand, the automotive field is a harsh environment for electronic devices.
Equipements are exposed to a wide range of mechanical, electrical and thermal stresses.
A running engine generates plenty of vibrations and mechanical stress.
Wear out electrical contacts, solder joints and connections.
It generates heat and thermal stress.
A vehicle can be exposed to large temperature variations during its lifetime.

% Architecture systemes automobiles
%TODO
A vehicle is constituted by a multitude of electronic modules, interconnected with cables.
This architecture is very challenging for robust against electrical disturbances

SHowed that longer cables result in increased exposure to electrostatic discharges

% Fiabilite vis a vis des ESD
%TODO
So far, the current context is more electronics, complex systems, intrisically more fragile, and with more responsabilities.
It is obvious that all kinds of failures must preemptively be studied and predicted.

Recently, a new family of failures motivated new research work.
Those new failures are due to the multiple and recent trends for electronic devices, and in the automotive field.
In the last years, the amount of embedded electronic devices in vehicles has widely increased.
In parallel, the size reduction of semiconductor devices and technologies has continued, leading to reduced dimensions, reduced supply voltages and increased \gls{esd} sensitivity.
Finally, the development of smarter and autonomous vehicles are giving electronic devices more responsabilities in regard of our safety.
Now, they are commonly responsible for critical functions, such as airbag and braking control, and assisted or autonomous driving.
In this context, electronic devices are required to perform as expected with absolute reliability and without unpredictible behavior that could lead to castrophic consequences.
In particular, the functional robustness of this kind of devices must be guaranteed even in the event of an electrostatic discharge.
