\section{State of the art in silicon-level operating ESD investigation}

Section 3 gave a good integration to how ESD events are generated in laboratories.
Going further, we are interested in how those events propagate inside electronic equipment, reach \gls{IC} and cause them to malfunction.
Ultimately, the goal is to establish an analysis method and predict early that an \gls{IC} will be weak against \gls{esd}.
So far, a few studies in the litterature have described test methods and modeling approaches to debug the behavior of
integrated circuits in operation when they are exposed to \gls{esd}.

Define soft-failure ?


\subsection{Test generators for operating ESD investigation}

TLP is clearly the most widely used ESD generator
VF-TLP
DPI - IEC 62215
IEC 61000-4-2

\subsection{Observation methods for failure detection and localisation}

EMMI
Near-field scan ?

\subsection{Modeling methods of soft-failures for Integrated Circuits}

IBIS
Spice
etc.
