\section{Modeling method application to a TLP generator}
\label{sec:tlp-modeling}

% Illustrate the method with a practical case
The methodology previously described in section \ref{sec:esd-modeling} is applied to the \gls{tlp} bench at NXP laboratory in Toulouse.
It is a good illustration on how to use the library of models for simulating a complete system.
Also, this particular testbench is widely used in NXP for characterizing and testing products.
The model described hereafter is used for instance to validate non-linear frequency model of passive devices.

% Describe the approach
To demonstrate its accuracy, the bench model is verified with an extensive simulation versus measurement comparison flow.
First, its behavior is measured under different loads and at different charging amplitudes.
The setup is identical for each simulation and measurement and is given Fig. \ref{fig:setup-cz-tlp-model}.

  \label{fig:setup-cz-tlp-model}
\end{figure}

% Continue describing the approach
All the recorded time-domain waveforms serve as a reference for the modeling.
The list of test loads is constituted of resistors, capacitors and inductors of different values.
A first version of the testbench model is built, taking into account elements that physically exists.
It is tested with a first \gls{spice} simulation for a resistive load and charging voltage, and waveforms are compared against measurements.
If results correlate, the validation is continued with another load or another amplitude.
If results do not correlate, the model needs corrections.
Usually, some part of the curve will match the measurement, but others will not and call for improvements.
It can be convenient to try improving a single part of the waveform at a time.
Properties of time-domain reflectometry are helpful for locating where the model needs adjustments.
Indeed, with \gls{tdr}, a portion of the curve in time corresponds to a physical location inside the system.
If the fall time of the pulse is wrong for instance, then it can mean that some device that smooths the discharge is missing at the far end of the discharge cable.
It is also very convenient to observe pictures of the system taken during testing while building the model, because some small elements might easily be missed out or forgotten from the preliminary observation, yet they might impact waveforms a lot.
If some minor sections of the curves really cannot be matched using the system schematic as reference, then parasitic devices can be added.
All of these steps should quickly converge on an accurate ESD model.

\end{figure}

% Explain how the model, how it was constructed
The complete model is detailed in Fig. \ref{fig:complete-tlp-model}.
Similarly to all TLPs, the principle of operation is rather straightforward.
Initially, the relay is left open while the \SI{50}{\nano\second} coaxial cable on the left is being charged by the high voltage \gls{dc} supply.
The \SI{10}{\mega\ohm} resistor ensures that the cable charges slowly to avoid oscillations, and isolates the high voltage supply from the pulse.
The two \SI{1}{\femto\farad} capacitors placed at each end of the discharge cable help the simulator respect the initial condition for the charging voltage.
The cable is pre-charged to accelerate the simulation.
After the relay, a \SI{50}{\ohm} resistor can be found, intended as an attenuator.
Despite having a value of \SI{50}{\ohm} like the coaxial cables, this resistor creates an impedance mismatch.
It is the perfect illustration of a small element that is easily missed out but impacts waveforms a lot.
A current probe is connected immediately after the attenuator, and a voltage probe is connected at the output of the generator.
Position of the probes are important as well, to reproduce the timeshift between them.
The short transmission line represented by a \SI{150}{\pico\second} coaxial cable is a piece of bare wire.
It creates impedance mismatches because it has an estimated characteristic impedance of \SI{280}{\ohm}.
Finally, two discharge paths are possible inside the generator depending on the configuration of the switch on the output.
The direct path is at the bottom, where the pulse goes straight out from the generator.
The top path provides a series resistance that limits the discharge current.

% Detail a first comparison with 25 ohms
A first comparison between measurement and simulation is given in Fig. \ref{fig:comparison-tlp-load}.
With a \SI{25}{\ohm} resistor and a charging voltage of \SI{500}{\volt}, a current of \SI{4.5}{\ampere} (I\textsubscript{TLP}) and a voltage of \SI{125}{\milli\volt} (V\textsubscript{TLP}) are recorded.
The ratio of V\textsubscript{TLP}/I\textsubscript{TLP} between \SI{40}{\nano\second} to \SI{100}{\nano\second} is equal to \SI{25}{\ohm} as expected.
The small difference in the second step is due to a small mismatch between the defined charging voltage on the actual TLP bench and the value really applied onto the line.
It can be easily corrected in simulation by adding a small offset to the charging voltage.
Until \SI{220}{\nano\second}, both curves match closely.
After this time, some differences appear due to small modeling errors.
Because of the reflected waves, the errors accumulate and become significant, but only after the main part of the pulse.
Indeed, most ESD investigations focus on the part of the discharge below \SI{120}{\nano\second} which is the more relevant for the analysis because it actually represents voltage and current inside the device under test.

  \label{fig:comparison-tlp-load}
\end{figure}

% Second comparison with a short circuit
Same comparison is performed on a short circuit in Fig. \ref{fig:comparison-tlp-short}.
The goal is to test the extreme conditions where the model is going to be used.
As expected the voltage is null and the current is close to the maximum \SI{10}{\ampere} supplied by the TLP (\SI{500}{\volt} through \SI{50}{\ohm}).
At \SI{120}{\nano\second}, a large difference is observed between the two curves.
It is actually a measurement issue due to the oscilloscope clamping amplitude outside the observation window.
Because this is a limitation of the equipment, it is not modeled inside the simulation.

  \caption{Voltage and current waveforms comparison : \SI{500}{\volt} charging voltage on a short circuit}
  \label{fig:comparison-tlp-short}
\end{figure}

% Third comparison on an open circuit
Finally, the process is repeated on an open circuit in Fig. \ref{fig:comparison-tlp-open}.
Observations are similar to the previous figures.
The voltage is recorded at \SI{220}{\volt}, corresponding to a bit less than half the TLP charging voltage.
For an ideal TLP, the value would be exactly \SI{250}{\volt}.
Due to the \SI{50}{\ohm} resistor between signal and ground inside this TLP bench, the voltage is slightly lower.
The current is close to \SI{0}{\ampere} because the load is an open circuit and does absorb current.
Between \SI{100}{\nano\second} and \SI{120}{\nano\second}, the same clamped measurement issue than previously is observed on the current waveform.

  \caption{Voltage and current waveforms comparison : \SI{500}{\volt} charging voltage on open circuit}
  \label{fig:comparison-tlp-open}
\end{figure}

% Fourth load is capacitive
So far, only resistive loads were tested.
Capacitors are interesting to validate models with non real impedance.
The response of the generator on a \SI{1}{\nano\farad} capacitor is given in Fig. \ref{fig:comparison-tlp-capa}.
Between \SI{40}{\nano\second} and \SI{100}{\nano\second}, voltage and current are not stable, however measurement and simulation correlate well.
This is very interesting because it validates the behavior of the generator in dynamic regime, with large varying signals.
The near-linear voltage curve is due to the capacitor being charged at nearly constant current by the TLP.
The slope of this linear curve is directly related to the capacitor value.

\end{figure}

% More validations in Annex
More simulation and validation curves are provided in Annex \ref{apx:tlp-validation-curves}, for different loads and amplitudes.
The goal of all those validations is to verify the model at both nominal and boundary conditions.
Overall, the model is good and fits very well the measurements, demonstrating the validity of the modeling method.
