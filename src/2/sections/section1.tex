\section{System-level ESD modeling method}
\label{sec:esd-modeling}

% Context is a competitive environment, where any tool can make a difference
The electronic design world is highly competitive, and especially the automotive field.
For companies to stay performant, it is vital to design products as fast as possible, with lowest possible costs, while guaranting expected quality.
On the other hand, electronics systems are complex to design and it is almost impossible to get the design right at the first manufacturing pass.
As the project moves forward in the design cycle and reaches new milestones, every redesign and modification becomes exponentially more costly.
For instance, modifying properties of a few transistors inside an integrated circuit during the early design phase comes almost for free.
It takes a few minutes for a designer to make the changes.
However, if this change is done after a first tape-out, many more steps must be executed.
It still takes a few minutes to a designer to make the changes, but now the top layout of the product must be updated, a new tapeout must prepared, a new set of lithographic photomasks must be prepared.
After a few months of manufacturing time, and testing time of the new part, the modification is landed.
In the process, it has cost a lot of time and manpower to the company.
Therefore, to remain competitive, the amount of design-manufacturing phases must be kept to a bare minimum, ideally to a single pass.
In this context, any tool capable of detecting early issues, enabling to prevent them before manufacturing, is highly valuable.

%TODO: Schema with design cycle + cost increase at each step

% Simulations are vital
Electrical simulations are the corner-stone of modern, computer-aided electronic design.
They constitute a fundamental tool used massively in integrated circuit and system development.
Silicon-manufacturing companies put a lot of effort to develop highly accurate models of their integrated technologies.
In those environments, accuracy of standard analog simulations is rightfully taken for granted.
For electrostatic and electromagnetic simulations though, the situation is different.
By nature, electrostatic discharge are very fast and highly non-linear signals.
Those events occupy a much larger frequency spectrum than waveforms usally met in standard analog simulations.
It is essential to verify the accuracy of models and simulations.
Models must be validated against actual measurement data, and in many different test conditions, including powered and unpowered conditions.

% Need to simulate from source to input for soft-failure analysis
In this chapter, a methodology for building electrical ESD models is proposed.
It enables simulation of waveforms from the ESD source to an integrated circuit pin.
This is a preliminary step for enabling simulation of soft-failures inside the chip.
The proposed methodology is modular and offers to reuse models between common devices found in ESD laboratories.
A typical ESD test setup comprises equipments such as DC sources, oscilloscopes, and stress generators.
Equipments are connected together with wires, coaxial cables, twisted wire pairs, etc.
The integrated circuit under test is often soldered onto a printed circuit board.
\gls{PCB}s usually host multiple kind of discrete devices, such as passive devices, ESD protections, common-mode chokes, relays, etc.
Components are connected together by metal tracks.
The goal of the proposed methodology is to build a library of all those elements, from lab equipments down to tiny discrete components.
Each model of the library will be qualified independently with individual characterization and comparison with its model.

% Assemble models together to build the complete thing
%TODO: Etoffer
After the library is constructed, models can be connected together to simulate the entire system.
The topology of the system serves as a blueprint for connecting models.

\subsection{Transmission line}

% Cables and delays identified as important for esd sims - because of similar order of magnitude
Cables are critial elements in any \gls{esd} test setup.
They introduce significant propagation delays in regard of the duration of an electrostatic discharge.
A 50\textOmega{} coaxial cable has a propagation ratio of approximately 5 ns/m.
In a laboratory, it is common to find cables of tens of centimers to a couple of meters long, resulting in delays between 1 ns and 10 ns.
As a comparison, the scale of an electrostatic discharge is a few hundred nanoseconds.
Both values are near the same order of magnitude and a large impact from cables on the simulation can logically be expected.
Cables, microstrip lines, wires and electrical propagation media behave as transmission lines.
Transmission lines were originally analysed by J. Maxwell, L. Kelvin and O. Heavyside and a huge amount of studies on the topic are available in the litterature \cite{branin-tl-ref, hf-coax,lossy-tl,emc-analysis-tl}.

% Cables can be a source of oscillations
Cables can also be a source of ringing oscillations if the circuit contains impedance mismatches, which is often the case.
Oscillation period is directly related to the cable length.
In this situation, a delay even less than 1 ns can have a strong impact on waveforms.
Therefore, coaxial cables, long \gls{pcb} traces and any element that generates a significant delay superior to the nanosecond should be modelled.

% Emphasize that a good line model is essential given how often the TLP is used for analysis in the ESD field
Transmission line pulsing was used extensively during this study.
As a remainder, it consists primarily in the discharge of a coaxial cable.
Thus, proper modelling of coaxial cables is useful in that regard as well.

% model delays with lossless TL
Transmission lines are characterized by their characteristic impedance, supposedly constant on the entire line.
It is determined by its cross-sectional dimensions and constituting materials.
For coaxial cables, common characteristic impedances are 50\textOmega{} or 75\textOmega{}.
This value is equivalent to the resistance that could be measured statically between outer and inner conductors for an \textbf{infinitely long} transmission line.
All transmission lines are lossy, meaning that some a part of the incoming power traversing it is dissipated.
In most cases though, losses are very small and negligible, and the line is considered lossless.
The behavior of the line is also frequency-dependant.
Losses, characteristic impedance and other properties can change above certain frequencies.
For frequencies below a GHz, most cables and metal strips can be correctly approximated by a lossless and non frequency-dependant line.

% How is a transmission line mathematically modelled
Physically, a transmission line can be seens as a succession of infinitely small unit elements.
Each element is modeled by an inductance \textdelta{}L, a capacitance \textdelta{}C and sometimes a leakage resistance or conductance.
Those unit values are directly related to the characteristic impedance Z\textsubscript{c} as described in Eq. \ref{eq:characteristic-impedance}.
\gls{Zc} is the also expressed as the ratio of voltage and current of a single wave propagating along the line.

\begin{equation}
Z_{c} = \sqrt{\frac{\delta L}{\delta C}}
\label{eq:characteristic-impedance}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Distributed model}

% Distributed model
The most popular line model in the ESD field is based on lumped capacitance and inductance.
The model is a series of lumped L-C networks as illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:dis-line-model}.
Values for the element can be computed from the characteristic impedance \gls{Zc} with Eq. \ref{eq:characteristic-impedance}.

\begin{figure}[!h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{src/2/figures/lc_ladder.pdf}
  \caption{Electrical distributed LC ladder model of a lossless transmission line}
  \label{fig:dis-line-model}
\end{figure}

\begin{equation}
\delta t = \sqrt{\delta L.\delta C}
\label{eq:unit-delay}
\end{equation}

% A string of unit elements form the total model
Each element induces a propagation delay \textdelta{}t, whose values can be computed from the unit inductance and capacitance with Eq. \ref{eq:unit-delay}.
In a string of connected unit elements, the individual delays add up.
With enough elements, the delay and behavior of the complete cable is reproduced.

% Tradeoff between amount of elements and
During modelling, it is tempting to take large values for \textdelta{}L and \textdelta{}C, to get a large unit delay.
Doing so reduces the amount of unit elements, and speeds up the simulation.
However, there is a tradoff between the delay of the unit element and the accuracy of the simulation.
A smaller unit delay increases accuracy of the model at large frequencies, but more elements are required for the total cable, resulting in longer simulation times.
On the other hand, a larger unit delay reduces the bandwidth of the model, which may be unsuitable for accuracy, even if simulation times are improved.

% How to calculate the unit values ?
By resolving the equation system constituted \ref{eq:characteristic-impedance} and \ref{eq:unit-delay}, it is possible to extract formula for L (Eq. \ref{eq:unit-inductance}) and C (Eq. \ref{eq:unit-capacitance}).
Values depend on the characteristic impedance Z\textsubscript{C}, the total cable delay \textDelta{}t and the amount N of lumped elements in the model.

\begin{equation}
L = \frac{Z_{C}.\delta t }{N}}
\label{eq:unit-inductance}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
C = \frac{\delta t}{N.Z_{C}}}
\label{eq:unit-capacitance}
\end{equation}

% Perks and disavantages
The distributed model supports easily lossy transmission lines by adding a unit resistance or conductance between signal and ground, or in series with the signal.
On the other hand, this model does not scale well as cables get longer.
To keep the same bandwidth with a longer cable, the only solution is to increase the element count, resulting in longer simulation time.
Also, this model will always be bandwidth limited, otherwise it would require an infinite amount of infinitely small elements.

\subsubsection{Two-port network model}

% Behavioral model
The two-port network model described by H. Branin \cite{branin-tl-ref} is a much better alternative to the distributed model.
It can describe efficiently and with great accuracy the behavior of uniform lossless transmission lines.
The model is constituted of two voltage-controlled voltage sources and two resistors (Fig. \ref{fig:beh-line-model}).
Compared to the distributed model, the behavioral model has by design an infinite bandwith, and is extremely fast to simulate.
It also is constant in complexity, because the simulation time is independant of the cable's delay or required bandwidth

\begin{figure}[!h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{src/2/figures/behavioral_line_model.pdf}
  \caption{Electrical behavioral model of a lossless transmission line}
  \label{fig:beh-line-model}
\end{figure}

Equations \ref{eq:beh-line-1} and \ref{eq:beh-line-2} describe the behavior of the voltage-controlled voltage sources.

\begin{equation}
V_{C1}(t) = V_{2}(t - \Delta t) + Z_{C}.I_{2}(t - \Delta t)
\label{eq:beh-line-1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
V_{C2}(t) = V_{1}(t - \Delta t) + Z_{C}.I_{1}(t - \Delta t)
\label{eq:beh-line-2}
\end{equation}

% Explain the equations
Z\textsubscript{C} is the characteristic impedance of the line and \textDelta{}t the propagation delay between both ports.
Overall, the equations describes a system where voltage and current at both ports are defined by the combination of a forward travelling wave and a backward travelling wave.
An example implementation in VHDL-AMS is provided in Listing \ref{lst:tline}.

\begin{code}
\inputminted[frame=single]{VHDL}{src/2/snippets/tline.vhdl}
\caption{Transmission line behavioral VHDL-AMS model}
\label{lst:tline}
\end{code}

\subsubsection{Comparison}

% Compare both models to know which one is preferrable
Simulations are ran to compare both models.
The expected theoretical response is a perfectly rectangular waveform measured at the load, because the transmission line is ideal and the load purely resistive.
The setup is given in Fig. \ref{fig:lines-testbench} and consists in injecting a rectangular pulse with a risetime of 1 ps into a load through the modelled transmission line.
Different load values are employed to observe the performance and accuracy of each model.
The transmission line to model has been chosen to a delay of 100ns and a characteristic impedance of 50 \textOmega.
Both values correspond to the cable usually employed in a transmission line pulsing generator and are thus very realistic.

%TODO: Simulation with 10

\begin{figure}[!h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{src/2/figures/tline_validation_setup.pdf}
  \caption{Line model validation testbench}
  \label{fig:lines-testbench}
\end{figure}

Overall, the behavioral model outperforms the distributed model for representing a perfect transmission line.
It reproduces exactly the 1ps risetime on the load in all configurations (Fig. \ref{fig:lines-simulations}).
The distributed model is either not as accurate or much slower to simulate.

\begin{table}[!h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}lllll@{}}
\toprule
amount N         &  10           & 100        &  1000      &   10000    \\ \midrule
simulation time  &  15 ms        & 170 ms     &  7.5 s     &   135 s    \\
increase ratio   &  -            & x10        &  x44       &   x18      \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Impact of the amount of unit elements on the simulation times (the 2 port model has a constant simulation time of about 20 ms)}
\label{tab:tline-impact-simulation-time}
\end{table}

For good accuracy, individual delay must be 2 or 10 times smaller than the shortest rise time.
Also, simulators with variable timestep have trouble reproducing appropriately oscillating events.
Simulated period is often wrong compared to what is mathematically expected.
Oscillations also force the simulators to fall back to the smallest timestep, considerably increasing simulation times.
To simulate a 100 ns TLP with a 100 ps risetime using the distributed model, it would require unit elements with a of 10ps.
10000 elements would be required to model the line, which is rather important and increases simulation time.
Even with 10000 elements the resolution is still too small to obtain a clean risetime \ref{fig:lines-simulations}.

\begin{figure}[!h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{src/2/figures/tline_comparison.png}
  \caption{Lumped versus two-port models comparison in simulation (charging voltage 1V)}
  \label{fig:lines-simulations}
\end{figure}

In conclusion, the two-port model should always be preferred over the lumped model.
This is obviously the approach used for all transmission line modelling presented in this document.

\subsection{Passive devices}

% Passive devices are everywhere
Discrete passive devices are the most common kind of devices found on \gls{pcb}.
Capacitors, inductors and resistors logically impact \gls{esd} waveforms.
Their properties change at high frequencies and high-power levels of electrostatic discharges \cite{capa-esd-cz}.
Nominal values easily vary by an order of magnitude.
At frequencies above a few MHz, parasitic devices of any discrete component cause a degradation of performance.
For sufficently high frequencies, the parasitic device can prevail over the nominal function.
This is how a capacitor can exhibit a inductive behavior above its resonance frequency.

% In what frequency range are ESD active, and are those limitations in effect
The frequency content of an electrostatic discharges was characterized in \cite{fft-esd}.
The study focused on air discharges and non-shielded discharges that radiate heavily.
In particular, the spectrum of the IEC 61000-4-2 standard \cite{iec61000-4-2} was recorded.
It is shown that the majority of the frequency content is below 1GHz, with important magnitude until tens of MHz.
This corresponds to the frequency range where parasitic behavior becomes important.
Therefore for \gls{esd} simulations, passive devices require models that take those parasitic devices into account.

% Not all device need parasitic device modelling
In practice, it was found that only some passive devices in a system have a notable impact on the waveform at high-frequencies.
For others, using a regular electrical model is sufficient.
Decoupling capacitors were noticed to require parasitic device modelling.
Since they are connected between a voltage reference (supply voltage) and a reference (ground), they have a strong impact on the disturbance waveforms that an \gls{ic} pin is exposed to.
Passive device models working at frequencies below 1GHz are given in Fig. \ref{fig:rlc-esd-models} for inductors, resistors and capacitors.
The parasitic devices are represented in orange.

\begin{figure}[!h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{src/2/figures/rlc_models.pdf}
  \caption{High-frequency (< 1GHz) models for resistor, capacitor and inductor}
  \label{fig:rlc-esd-models}
\end{figure}

% How to tune those models
Those models are easily parameterized.
Values can be extracted with an impedance meter capable of measuring impedances to at least 100 MHz.
The extraction is performed in small-signal conditions, which can be an issue as will be later detailed.
Fig. \ref{fig:frequency-response-capa} displays the magnitude and phase versus frequency of a 6.8 nF \gls{smd} capacitor.
The capacitor exhibits a perfect behavior up to 45MHz.
The slope of the curve below 45 MHz is directly related to the capacitor value (see Equation \ref{eq:capacitor-impedance}).
Below 45 MHz, the phase has a value of $-90$ degrees, corresponding to the theory.


%TODO: Check this equation
\begin{equation}
\delta M/ \delta f = C. \omega = 2.\omega .C.f
\label{eq:capacitor-impedance}
\end{equation}

% What are the parasitic devices in this curve
At the resonant frequency, the capacitor is equivalent to a non-ideal short-circuit, basically a low-value resistor.
This resistor, also called \gls{esr}, is both a parasitic device and the series resistance in the high-frequency model presented earlier.
Beyond 45 MHz, the capacitor behaves as an inductor.
The phase shift is the one of an inductor at $+90$ degrees.
This second slope is determined by the parasitic inductor value (see equation \ref{eq:inductor-impedance}).
In conclusion, the values for parasitic inductor and resistor can be computed very easily from a measurement.

\begin{equation}
\delta M/ \delta f =  -L.\omega = -2.\omega .L.f
\label{eq:inductor-impedance}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[!h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{src/2/figures/capa_hf_response.png}
  \caption{Magnitude and phase frequency response of a 6.8nF capacitor}
  \label{fig:frequency-response-capa}
\end{figure}

% Impact of dimensions on parasitic values
% In the case of capacitors, for a given package, first observations tend to show few variations for the parasitic inductance, even with capacitors of different values and sizes. The parasitic inductance seems mostly related to the kind of package, and measured values are between 1nH and 5nH. This observation tends to indicate that there is no need to characterize every single passive device. Instead, a global parasitic model per package should suffice.

% Non-linear high power behavior
So far, only the frequency-related behavior was detailed.
For high power and amplitudes, most passive devices also suffer of nominal ratings variations.
\gls{mlcc} are concerned about this phenomenon \cite{capa-esd-cz}, where the capacitance decreases at high voltages.
On the contrary, capacitors built with the X7R technology are much most resilient in high regime conditions and exhibit little variations \cite{fabien-capas}.

% Conclusion
Parasitic device modelling for passive devices is a pretty common technique in high-frequency, \gls{emc} and \gls{esd} simulations.
For \gls{esd}, using parasitic models is not systematically required, but it is an important tool to remember when building a system model.
There is still room for model improvement, with MLCC capacitors at high-regime regime for instance.

\subsection{ESD protections}
\label{esd-protection-modelling}

%
ESD protection is the most extensively studied device in the \gls{esd} field.
ESD protections designate a class of devices rather than a particular electronic component.
ESD protections can be realized in multiple ways, with diodes, thryistors, \gls{tvs}, silicon-controlled rectifiers, etc.
Overall, ESD protection are devices in high-impedance below a triggering voltage, low-impedance above it and capable of absorbing significant amount of currents temporarily.
Overall, there are two kinds of modelling methods with physically-based models and behavioral models.

% Physical modelling
Physical modelling is often referred as \gls{tcad} modelling, for Technology Computer-Aided Design.
TCAD modelling is performed by ESD designers to evaluate performance and robustness of their devices before manufacturing.
In TCAD, devices can be represented as 2 or 3 dimensionnal meshes \ref{fig:esd-protection-tcad-model}.
The model is represented by a mesh, composed of triangle primitives.
A TCAD model generally requires extensive preparation before being ready for simulation.
Each manufacturing step is first described.
A very broad amount of parameters must be described, such as concentration of doping materials, temperature, etc.
Afterwards, the 2D or 3D shape of the lithographic photomasks are defined with sets of coordinates.
Finally, all this information is provided to the TCAD program that simulates the manufacturing process.
This step consist in computing for each triangle primitive of the mesh several parameters, such as the concentration of doping materials.
This step is computationnally intensive and can take days to complete.
Afterwards, the model is ready for electrical simulation.
2D meshes are faster to prepare and simulate than 3D meshes.
However, 2D meshes do not reproduce 3D corner of device.
In those areas, the the rectangular shape of a corner creates higher electric fields than the sides, and can be a major failing area.
As a result, the robustness of a device estimated by a 2D TCAD simulation can actually be lower than the reality.
However, experimented TCAD designers with sufficient know-how are capable of performing very accurate simulations.

\begin{figure}[!h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{src/2/figures/tcad_process.png}
  \caption{3D mesh representation of TCAD model (Credit: M Johnson and Wikipedia \cite{tcad-process})}
  \label{fig:esd-protection-tcad-model}
\end{figure}

% Behavioral modelling
%TODO: Improve VHDL-AMS description
Behavioral modelling is widely used for studying interactions between the protection and a circuit.
The I(V) curve extracted from a \gls{tcad} simulation or a \gls{tlp} measurement is reproduced by an equivalent model \cite{modelling-diode-esd, esd-diode-compact-model, tvs-modeling}.
By nature, ESD protections switch from a high-impedance to a low-impedance state.
In the case of snapback devices, the impedance change is very abrupt, leading to discontinuities of the slope of the I(V) curve.
Snapback devices have non-monotonous curves, where multiple values of current can be found for a given voltage, depending on the state of the device.
Large and sudden discontinuities are very challenging for classic \gls{spice} simulations, where convergence issues rise and prevent the simulator to complete.
To overcome those difficulties, modelling languages like VHDL-AMS or Verilog-A are extremely helpful.
They enable to describe models with very useful primitives such as equation formulation, direct support for signal integration and derivative, combined digital and analog solvers for improved convergence.
Using VHDL-AMS for modelling ESD protections was proposed by N. Monnereau in \cite{phd-monnereau}.
The original solution proposed to handle snapback devices was to describe their behavior using a state machine.
To each state of the machine is associated a slope value on the I(V) curve response \ref{fig:esd-protection-state-machine}.

\begin{figure}[!h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{src/2/figures/iv_state_machine.pdf}
  \caption{ESD protection state machine and corresponding I(V) curve}
  \label{fig:esd-protection-state-machine}
\end{figure}

A possible implementation in VHDL-AMS is given in Listing \ref{lst:snapback-device}.
The active machine state is stored in a digital variable called \textit{flag}.
Initially, it is at the value 0 representing the off state.
When voltage becomes superior to the triggering voltage \textit{v\_1}, \textit{flag} takes the value of 1 and the protection turns on.
For the protection to return to the off state, current flowing through the protection must become smaller than a very low value.
It is generally the physical behavior observed with thyristors for instance, and incidentally helps the simulator to converge and avoid oscillations between the on-state and the off-state.

\inputminted[frame=single,breaklines=true]{VHDL}{src/2/snippets/beh_snapback.vhd}
\caption{Single snapback behavioral device model}
\label{lst:snapback-device}
\end{code}

%TODO
% Example time-domain simulation
%Can see that first the protection is at the off-state, voltage rises
%Than voltage becomes suddenly smaller, and current increases
%The protection has turned on and absorbs current

% Conclusions and future work on ESD protections
The two main kinds of methods for modelling ESD protections have been presented.
They enable accurate simulations of interactions between a circuit and a protection.
Future improvements of these methods could focus on triggering delay and overshoot modelling.

\subsection{Common mode filter}

% Common mode choke
Common mode chokes (CMC) or common mode filters (CMF) allow differential currents to flow while blocking common-mode currents.
They are composed of two coils wounded around a single core.
CMC offer a very low impedance to differential currents, and a large impedance to common-mode currents.
They are frequently encountered in electronic systems to protect differential inputs and supply inputs \cite{cmc-for-emc-protection, cmc-esd, alternative-cmc-emi-noise}.
Unlike regular RC-network filtering, CMC isolate from common mode disturbances where both signal and ground voltages shift.
They are effective to protect differential inputs from common noise while preserving integrity of a differential signal.
Chokes are frequently used for reducing emmission in \gls{emc} tests, and increasing immunity of a system to conducted disturbances.

\begin{figure}[!h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{src/2/figures/cmc.png}
  \caption{CMF linear model - from \cite{usb2ESDProtection}}
  \label{fig:cmf-model}
\end{figure}

CMF were studied and modeled for ESD in \cite{usb2ESDProtection}.
Fig. \ref{fig:cmf-model} gives an example of a linear model.
L31 and L42 represent the mutual inductance of the CMC.
C1 and C2 model the parasitic coupling between the two coils, and all the other elements account for parasitic behavior of the coil wires.
The device is tuned from a small-signal characterization.
However, electrostatic discharges put devices in highly non-linear behavior.
It is recommended in \cite{esd-codesign} that ferrite-based devices should be modelled with a non-linear model.
Thus, L31 and L42 are represented in the model using a non-linear equation.
Using this method, it is possible to build accurate common-mode filter models suitable for electrostatic discharge simulations.

\subsection{Ferrite beads}

%TODO
% Description and function
Ferrite bead are passive filtering devices, often found in \gls{ic} decoupling networks.
They remove high-frequency noise in supply lines, which is why they are very often met on power cables for consumer equipments such as laptop supplies for instance.
They behave as a second-order low-pass filter.
In the ESD field, multiple filtering strategies with second and third order filters involving ferrites were studied in \cite{filter-strategies-esd}.
Some configurations claimed a very positive impact on the latchup immunity of the chip under test.

\begin{figure}[!h]

  \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{src/2/figures/ferrite_bead_model.pdf}
  \caption{Ferrite bead model}
  \label{fig:ferrite-model}
\end{figure}

% electrical model
Ferrite beads are modeled for ESD in \cite{mixedModeESDSims} with a resistor-capacitor-inductor network given in \ref{fig:ferrite-model}.
The main coil is represented by an inductance L, a parasitic resistance R\textsubscript{p} and capacitance C\textsubscript{p} and a series resistance R\textsubscript{s}.
Those parameters can be extracted using an impedance meter, or by performing an S-parameter characterization.
