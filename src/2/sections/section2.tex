\section{IC level ESD modeling}

\gls{ic} designs

circuit complexity

dense integration leads to issues like couplings

substrate can be a propagation path for ESD

grounds cannot be treated as reference inside the circuit because of non negligeable metal track resistance.

Need to identify if those points are an issue for ESD simulations.

The goal is to keep schematics as close as possible from the original design schematic

\subsection{Construction of a simplified ESD model for an integrated function}

Instanciate design blocks that are to be tested in operating ESD conditions

Add ESD protection models

Using the layout, evaluate a few series resistance (tested pin to ESD protection, grounds, etc).

Add bonding wire model
