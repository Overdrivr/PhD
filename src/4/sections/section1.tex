\section{Test vehicule description and failure signature}

This chapter focuses on the functionnal failure caused by an \gls{esd} of an integrated function.
The studied function is the primary supply of a complex automotive \gls{asic}.
This supply plays a critical role in the functionning of the entire product.
It is connected to the battery of the vehicle, and is the first block of the product to start.
It wakes up and powers all other functions inside the integrated circuit.

The primary supply processes the battery supply in a chained fashion (see Fig. \ref{testchip_overview}).
A first block (pre-regulator) clamps the battery voltage (that can reach up to 40V) to 9V, a more acceptable voltage for the silicium technology.
This clamped voltaged is then used to power up a bandgap reference.
Once properly started, this bandgap generates a 1.23 V voltage reference, stable accross a wide range of temperature, process variation and mismatchs.
The bandgap also outputs a 10uA current reference, stable in the same conditions.

After the bandgap, a \gls{ldo} regulator relies on the voltage reference to generate a stable 2.5V supply voltage, able to deliver and sustain up to 20mA.
This first regulator is connected externally to a 100nF decoupling capacitor to absorb peak currents and achieve stability.
This supply is used to supply most analog (digital ?) functions inside the integrated circuit.

A second regulator performs the same task, but starts with a delay compared to the first one.
It also ouputs a 2.5V supply, that powers digital logic inside the circuit.

In case of failure, the primary supply can cause the entire product to shut down.
Indeed, this entire system requires soft-start behavior to avoid generating harmful voltage spikes to powered functions.
This functionnality enforces the system to start on a \br{long} period of time, in the order of a hundred microseconds.

When the system is stressed with an \gls{esd}, voltages and currents are fluctuating inside the block.
Under certain conditions, and especially important stress levels, the block will detects some nodes going in undervoltage or overvoltage.
This will cause the block to go into safe or protected mode, where it will restart because the functionnality cannot be assured properly.
The direct consequence is that the block will require again a hundred microseconds to be again in normal operation mode.

This failure can in a first time be observed in simulation.
An \gls{ESD} is superimposed on the DC battery voltage.
This is the most likely entry point for a stress, because the \gls{IC} exposes a pin to the external workd and is usally connected to the battery via a long cable
To detect is a block reset happened, the voltage on the first voltage regulator is observed.
Fig. X shows the stress waveform on the input.

STRESS WAVEFORM INPUT

Fig. X shows a simulation where a small glitch can be observed on the regulated output, but without clear reset or soft-failure signature.
In this case, the block and the rest of the product is most likely not affected by the ESD.

WAVEFORM OUTPUT NO RESET

Fig. X shows a simulation where a clear reset hapened.
The output voltage is maintained by a 100nF capacitor.
However, it clearly goes down \br{after} the \gls{esd} and rises slowly afterward, a sign that the block went into full reset and restard.

\subsection{Conclusion regarding bottom-up block failure modeling method}

On paper, this method was rather promising in terms of applicability.
A block could be characterized once, and reused in different places.
The robustness of a full system could have been quickly and easily deduced from the models of its parts.

However, with the study case exposed earlier, several issues arose that clearly limit the ability of the model to perform as expected.

The main issue with this modelling method is the fact that it relies too much
on the value of the output load for performing the characterization of a block.
This load depends on many different parameters.
And this value will change in function out the block connected on the output (think about block-reuse)
Also, this value may not be constant in frequency.
And this value may also not be constant in time (multiple operating modes, biasing points, etc).

% SHOW SIMULATIONS FOR THIS PROBLEM OF IMPEDANCE VARIATION

% DIRECTIVITY - WE ASSUME STRESS AND FAILURES PROPAGATE FROM INPUT TO OUTPUT. MAY NOT BE THE CASE. ALSO, MAY NOT WORK IN REVERSE WITH SINGLE2MANY BLOCK CONNECTIONS

Another issue, this method is limited to a binary FAIL/NO FAIL criteria.
Not only this criteria is arbitrary (in some cases, the specification could be used to set it), but
for most purely-analog blocks, there will not be a clear failure, rather, most
nets will have degraded values until maybe biasing of the block completely fails.
In this case, the binary criteria hides a lot of information about the degradation.

ANY CLUES TO OVERCOME THESE ISSUES ?

ALSO, FAILURE MAY NOT PROPAGATE IN THIS ONLY WAY, BUT BACKWARD TOO

The main reason why this approach was investigated was for its very interesting modularity
that was highly suitable for block reuse workflow.

However, because of the intrisic interactions between block functions in an integrated circuit,
TRY TO EXPRESS BETTER WHAT PRINCIPLE OF THIS METHOD BOUNDS IT TO FAIL

this approach seems to be bound to fail for building a reusable model for an IC block that could predict
ESD failures at the architecture level and during the IC architecture phase.
