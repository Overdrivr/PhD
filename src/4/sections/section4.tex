\section{Application of Wunsch & Bell curves to arbitrary waveforms}
\label{sec:wb_for_arbitrary_wvfs}

% WB here based on amplitude/duration of square pulse
WB

% Reality is more arbitratry, time varying pulse

%TODO: Think about multiple pulses ?

\subsection{Integration method}

% Explain what this method is
Integration

% References to previous work with this approach

% Explain non-symetrical behavior

\subsection{Amplitude-distribution method}

% Explain what this method is
Distribution

% Explain how it solves non-symetrical behavior

% Explain difference with previous method ?

%

\subsection{Conclusions}

% Which one seems the more fitting ?
