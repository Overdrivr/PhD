\subsection{Application to the test vehicle}

The method described in both previous sections (\ref{sec:block-failure-cz} and \ref{sec:block-chaining}) is tested in simulation on real blocks.
More precisely, it will be tested against the regulation function of the testchip.

% Which pins are selected for characterization
This function is composed of three blocks, a pre-regulator, a bandgap and a regulator.
For each one, an input and output pin are selected.
The input/outputs that play a key role on the regulation function were selected on the regulation function.
Details of the selected pins is given in Table \ref{selected-pins-for-cz}.

\end{table}

% Talk about the characterization limits
The characterization is done using negative voltages.
The goal is to exploit the weakness of the testchip against negative pulses discovered and highlighted in section \ref{sec:testchip_study}.
Basically, it was observed for sufficiently high negative voltage a short pulse can cause a full restart of the system.
The time taken by this restart, observed on the regulator output, is several order of magnitudes longer than the original pulse injected on the pre-regulator input.

% failure criteria chosen
The failure criteria for the pre-regulator is a voltage lower than 0V on the output.
It corresponds to a situation worse than the unpowered state, where all nets are at 0V.
The failure criteria for the bandgap is a voltage lower than 1.25V on the 2.5V reference output.
Finally, the failure criteria for the regulator, which is also the failure criteria for the complete function, is a voltage lower than 2.1V on the 2.5V regulated output.
This criteria corresponds to a voltage below which digital cells using this supply will fail to function properly.

% Which load value for characterization
The test setup described in section \ref{sec:block-failure-cz} requires a characterization load to simulate the impact of neighbor blocks.
In a first time, a very simplistic model is employed for this load.
An arbitrary load value of 1M\textgreek{Omega}\ is initially chosen, just to perform a preliminary test.
The impact of this load on the characterization will be evaluated later on in the analysis.

% Simulation process
For each block, the characterization testbench is setup and a set of simulations is ran.
This set is calculated with the characterization range given in Table \ref{selected-pins-for-cz}.
This type of parameterized simulations can be efficiently distributed on multiple machines.
This way, the complete characterization of a block does not take longer than the time taken by a single simulation.
Once all simulations are run, the results are analysed and plotted using the method detailed in the previous sections.

% Talk about the output
These characterization curves are given in Figs. \ref{pre_regu_wb}, \ref{bandgap_wb} and \ref{regu_wb}.
The characterization of the pre-regulator (fig. \ref{pre_regu_wb}) is plotted using the stress amplitude only on the X axis.
The stress amplitude is the pulse voltage set in the pulse generator SPICE model.
On the other hand, the bandgap and regulator curves are using instead the voltage probed on the input net during the stress.

% Characterization done, now perform chaining
After the characterization phase, it is now possible to chain the models together.
The goal is to evaluate the entire function's robustness with the method described in \label{sec:block-chaining}.
A rectangular pulse is injected on the global input (pre-regulator input).
The chain of models is used to predict, without running any more simulations, the failure or not on the output pin.
For the purpose of this test, the input stress will be generated by a \gls{tlp} generator, producing a pulse of 100ns duration and -30V amplitude.

% Do it on one pulse config
First, the coordinaates (100ns, -30V) are reported on curve \ref{pre_regu_wb}, the first block model of the system.
This point indicates a failure on the output of the pre-regulator, for a duration of 500ns.
The failure criteria is 0V on the output.
This gives the next point coordinates (500 ns, 0V).
This point is reported on the bandgap's model, the next block in the system.
Using these coordinates in the curve \ref{bandgap_wb} indicates a failure on the bandgap output for about 800ns.
Since the failure criteria for the bandgap is 1.25V on the output, the next point coordinates are (800ns, 1.25V).
They are used as an input on the final block's model (fig. \ref{regu_wb}).
Reporting those coordinates, no failure is expected on the regulator output.

In conclusion, the model chain estimated that for a -50V 100ns stress on the input, the regulation function will not be at fault (output < 2.1V).

%TODO: SHOW ALL THREE CZ CURVES WITH POINT REPORT FROM ONE TO ANOTHER

% Perform standard complete simulation for reference
This result is then tested against a complete simulation of the entire regulation function (all three block).
The simulation circuit is given Fig. X.
This simulation uses transistor-level models, and will serve as a reference to compare the model-chain against it.
The same (100ns, -50V) rectangular pulse will be injected on the global input, and the global output will be monitored as well.
To check the validity of the model, we also monitor intermediate voltages, at the output of the pre-regulator and the bandgap.
The simulation of the input, pre-regulator output, bandgap output and final (regulator) output are given fig. X.

%TODO: SCHEMATIC FULL CIRCUIT

%TODO: PLOT TRANSIENT SIMULATIONS, USING 2 * 2 GRID, PLOTTING INPUT, PRE_REG_OUT, BANDGAP_OUT and REGU_OUT

% Result of the simulation
The simulation showed that for the given stress, the output will go below XXV for XXXns.
There is a rather large difference with the model chain.
To try to explain this difference, intermediates nodes are monitored.

% Error at the first block
The output of the pre-regulator is below X V (failure criteria) for XX ns in the full simulation while the model predicted XX ns.
Already, at this first block, there is a large difference between the simulation and the model.

% Error at the second block
The output of the bandgap (second block) shows even a higher difference.
In simulation, the output goes below XX V for XXX ns, while the model predicted XXX ns.

% Conclusion regarding this first simulation
Not only each curve introduces an important error, but errors tend to accumulate after each block.

% Test further simulation vs model
To test further the model versus the reference simulation, a set of different stresses are injected, with different properties.
The goal is to test the model on a larger set of input stresses.
For each stress, the result predicted by the model and the result obtained by the reference simulation are compared.
Results are summarized in table \ref{tab:comparison-multiple-pulses}.
The entire process is summarized in fig. X.

% Where does error come from ? Load impedance
Previously, it was indicated that all WnB curves were extracted with a fixed Zout = 1M\textOmega.
When connected together, each block (pre-regulator, bandgap, regulator) sees a load impedance on its output much different than that.
Thus, it is important to evaluate the impact of this value on the Wunsch and Bell characterization curve.
The pre-regulator is characterized again, this time with a load impedance of 100\textOmega.
This value is rather small impedance, but sufficiently high to not draw too much current on the pre-regulator.
This second characterization is given fig. X.

%TODO: CHARACTERIZATION WITH Z LOW IMPEDANCE

This characterization is compared with the one extracted with 1M\textOmega\.
To make the comparison easier, curves for failure above 1ns, 10ns, 100 ns and 1us were plotted separately (see fig. X).
