\section{Current limitations and potential improvements}

This generator not only reproduces the waveform on calibration patterns
It also correlates well with actual testing ESD guns when destroying ESD protections

Because of limitations, this tool was not used extensively throughout this study, but an improved model could be interesting.

Challenges: Use 8kV, 15kV HV supplies, with all implications (HV sustaining cables, switchs, etc).
