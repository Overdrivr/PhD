\section{Current limitations and potential improvements}

Developped a new alternative to TLP-HMM
Works well, quite robust against ringing oscillations and parasitic disturbances
This generator reproduces the waveform on calibration patterns
So far correlates well with actual testing ESD guns when destroying ESD protections

Needs improvement in terms of manufacturing, and maximum charging voltage
Limited by HV supply
Challenges: Use 8kV, 15kV HV supplies, with all implications (HV sustaining cables, switchs, etc).
New challenges to be solved, such as developping a TLP able to sustain 8kV 15kV charging voltage

Research work on this generator led to interesting discovery
Possible to make a link between a TLP failure level, on-resistance of ESD protection, and the HMM failure voltage.
Validated on a set of 10 different ESD protections
More work to test on a larger set, see if only happens with thermal breakdown
