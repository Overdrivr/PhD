\section{Testing}

Use actual product board
Perform powered on injection

Problem:
Even with a very well calibrated setup, up the IC pin, the defect is not
reproduced with the simulation.
Given that we have ringing behavior during the pulse injection, we suspect
that the failure comes from a coupling mechanism. Potentially, a coupling with
the substrate is suspected.

Couplings are layout-specific,
and as such, are not simulated by default and hard to simulate.

Back-annoted sims ?

During substrate coupling, a part of the ESD current is evacuated through the
substrate. If substrate potential rises locally above Vt of body diode, body diodes
can be turn on in direct.

Consequences: triggering or disabling functionnalities
