\section{Motivation}

TLP used throughout this document
Tool of choice for studying behavior at IC level, because very clean, controllable pulses in a shielded environment

But ultimately, ESD Gun is required to pass specifications
HMM specification [1] IEC 61000-4-2 and ISO 10605 standards [2][3] define the same pulse waveform with different application conditions
Virtually makes it the most widely used stress pulses in ESD testing and ESD qualification of products.
Together, these standards cover a very large amount of tested applications from equipment, boards, down to integrated circuit.

TLP can sometime correlate with ESD gun induced failures [REF], but not always
in some cases, this approach won’t work and no clear correlation can be established [5].
According to [4], this is particularly the case with 2k ESD gun discharge modules.

[5] demonstrates that some ESD structures in analog high-voltage technology have completely uncorrelated failure levels between TLP and HMM. Failure analysis shows that the failure mechanisms are different.
These few cases are problematic because then TLP testing cannot be blindly trusted to reproduce an ESD gun issue.

So the original pulse must be employed
For integrated circuits in particular, this step can be quite challenging
the pulse waveform is complex and makes to difficult analysis.


Ultimately, developped an ESD tester that combines flexibility and shielding of TLP + reproduces well-acknowledged Gun waveform.
Such approach has been explored successfully in the past by E. Grund [6] and Y. Cao [7].
%TODO: Comment alternatives
In [6], a TLP generator is modified by placing an impedance mismatch (resistor) between two coaxial lines.
On the other side, in [7], a capacitive discharge through a short coaxial cable is employed to generate an HMM-compliant pulse.

The setup described here is a different alternative
Based on propation delays to shape the pulse [ref to me ?].
The ultimate goal is to have a drop-in replacement for ESD guns when investigation is required.

%TODO: Speak about disturbances caused by radiated emissions that cannot be reproduced with a shielded generator
